If Google is using too much of its crawl budget on rendering, it could neglect to visit and index some of your pages, categorizing them as Discovered - Currently not indexed. <br><b>Pro Tip: </b>talk to your developers about the issue. Consider upgrading to more powerful servers and implementing caching strategies to improve this metric.",
